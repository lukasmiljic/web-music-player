## Music Player

Web music player built using vannila JS and CSS. The project started as me trying to copy the design of Spotify's Web Player, so at first I wasn't planning on adding any functionality, but as I keept learning more about JS I expanded the scope of the project.

Currently it loads music locally and the song info is somewhat hard-coded. In the future I would like to allow for more dynamic loading of songs. I plan on adding support for reading mp3 tags and the ability to change where you load music from as well as a few other things.

As of now it loads one album and displays it's songs. The app has all the basic features of a music player, allowing the user to play and pause the song, switch tracks using the next/previous track buttons, mute the playback, clicking on the playbar to jump around the song.

The background color of the app is also automatically chosen by getting the dominant color from the album cover. This was done by using  the color thief API.
